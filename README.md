# **Automated Attendance Face Recognition**

## **Project Overview**
The **Automated Attendance Face Recognition** system is designed to automate the process of attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. This project leverages computer vision to identify individuals and mark their attendance efficiently. The system can be used in educational institutions, workplaces, or any environment where attendance monitoring is necessary.

## **Features**
- **Face Recognition**: Detects and recognizes faces from images or live video feeds.
- **Attendance Logging**: Automatically marks attendance for recognized faces and stores records.
- **Real-time Processing**: Captures and processes video streams in real time for fast and accurate attendance.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Ensures data security and can be easily integrated into larger systems.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates attendance reports for individuals or groups over specific time periods.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Python**: Core programming language used.
- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
- **dlib/face_recognition library**: For face detection and recognition.
- **Flask/Django (Optional)**: For creating a web-based interface.
- **SQLite/MySQL**: For storing attendance records.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
To run this project locally, you will need the following:
- **Python 3.x** installed
- **pip** for package management
- Webcam or camera for live video feed

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-attendance-face-recognition.git
   cd automated-attendance-face-recognition
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare Dataset**
   - Add images of individuals in the `/dataset` directory. The folder structure should be as follows:
     ```
     dataset/
        person1/
            img1.jpg
            img2.jpg
        person2/
            img1.jpg
            img2.jpg
     ```

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. **Access Web Interface (Optional)**
   If you’ve implemented a web interface, access the app at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## **Usage**

- Launch the script to start face recognition.
- The system will automatically detect and log attendance for registered faces.
- You can view and export attendance reports from the system.
